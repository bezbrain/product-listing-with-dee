        <h1>Our Service</h1>
        <p>
          At Precisious, we make purchasing a vehicle simple, transparent, and
          customer-focused. Our process begins once a reservation fee or down
          payment is made. For full payments, a{" "}
          <span>70% deposit is collected upfront </span> , with the remaining
          balance due upon finalization.
        </p>
        <p>
          For financing,{" "}
          <span>the process begins after the down payment is completed </span> ,
          and ongoing payment terms will be arranged by our customer service
          team. Once the down payment is confirmed, we handle all the necessary
          paperwork and arrange for our courier service to deliver the vehicle
          directly to your address. If a monthly payment is missed under a
          financing plan, a <span>$25 late fee </span> (or an amount agreed upon
          in the contract) will be applied.
        </p>
        <h3>Each vehicle comes with:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>No additional mileage</li>
          <li>Two keys</li>
          <li>Bill of sale</li>
          <li>Temporary tag</li>
          <li>Clean title</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          You will have <span>two days </span> to test drive the vehicle or have
          it inspected by your mechanic. If you choose to keep it, youâ€™ll sign
          the final documents and either complete the payment or proceed with
          your financing agreement. If you decide not to keep the vehicle within
          the two-day test period, simply notify us, and our courier will
          arrange pickup. Your deposit will be refunded.{" "}
